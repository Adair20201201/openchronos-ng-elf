It seems like the default value in .cfg files is not taken into account for atleast modules/acc*.cfg. Investigate!

It would be nice if the order of the menu items could be set. First menu could then be clock and not temp as it is on my machine. (modules/config.py)

It would be nice if we didn't start in edit mode (openchronos.c)

In stopwatch when having a few laps and switching between them, you are unable to go back and view end time.

It would be nice if the menu system automatically changed to selected menu item if no button was pressed for x ms
