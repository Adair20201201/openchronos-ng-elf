It seems like the default value in .cfg files is not taken into account for atleast modules/acc*.cfg. Investigate!

Someimes lockup when a button is pressed (alarm -> change on/off alarm or hour ding)

It would be nice if the order of the menu items could be set. First menu could then be clock and not temp as it is on my machine. (modules/config.py)

It would be nice if we didn't start in edit mode (openchronos.c)

When setting date to 12-31 and then changing month to 11 then 31 isn't changed to 30 and pressing down wil set date to 32.

changing from mode 24h to 12h to 24h stays at 12h
