It seems like the default value in .cfg files is not taken into account for atleast modules/acc*.cfg. Investigate!

Someimes lockup when a button is pressed (alarm -> change on/off alarm or hour ding)

It would be nice if the order of the menu items could be set. First menu could then be clock and not temp as it is on my machine. (modules/config.py)

It would be nice if we didn't start in edit mode (openchronos.c)
